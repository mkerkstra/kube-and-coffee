# Kube and Coffee

Welcome to **Kube and Coffee**â€”our collaborative Kubernetes learning lab! This repository accompanies a series of hands-on sessions where we explore the fundamentals of Kubernetes together, building our skills one session at a time. Each session is self-contained, so we can experiment, break things, and learn as a team.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Docker** â€“ install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for macOS.
* **Visual Studio Code** â€“ with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

### Using Our Dev Container
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open it in VS Code and choose **Reopen in Container** when prompted.
3. The first build sets up Node.js, `kubectl`, `helm`, and `kind`. Our local Kubernetes cluster is created automatically using `.devcontainer/kind-config.yaml`, exposing ports `11434` and `3080` on the host for easy access.
4. (Optional) Run `install-ollama` inside the dev container to add [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) for AIâ€‘generated manifests. Example manifests for an Ollama service and a chat UI are included in `sessions/01-namespace-of-mind/`.
5. CoreDNS is deployed by default so our services can resolve each other via DNS.
